This is the iOS App controlling kooci (Pronounced "Cookie").
This app provides a Speech User Interface to make cooking easier.

## Inspiration

When cooking, we usually have the recipe opened on our smartphone or tablet, because who does own a traditional cookbook anymore when there are millions of recipes which can be found online! But as good as this variety is, we always struggle when we are in the middle of a recipe and the screen goes black. You either have your hands full of dough, need to stir while adding ingredients or are mixing beverages. Now you need to decide if you ruin your clean screen or interrupt your process and wash your hands again. So we decided to tackle this problem and developed kooci, your cooking companion!
